## Configuration

claws uses your standard AWS configuration:

- `~/.aws/credentials` - AWS credentials
- `~/.aws/config` - AWS configuration (region, profile)
- Environment variables: `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, etc.

Configuration is stored in `~/.config/claws/config.yaml` for profile preferences.

## Architecture

claws uses a simple architecture with custom implementations for each service:

```

├── cmd/claws/           # Entry point
├── internal/
│   ├── app/             # Main TUI application
│   ├── aws/             # AWS client management + helpers
│   ├── action/          # Action framework
│   ├── dao/             # Data Access Object interface
│   ├── log/             # Structured logging (slog-based)

│   └── view/            # View components
└── custom/              # Service implementations (DAO + Renderer + Actions)
```

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for details.
